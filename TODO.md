- Refine the new async code to my liking
- I removed query mode because I don't like it really and it wastes API calls, but also there's the chance that the listing title wouldn't contain the keyword but the description would, so maybe I should re-add it with that in mind? Or somehow get the description in the current mode? (That would probably require calls for each listing though which would be super expensive since the endpoint for getting listing details shares a rate limit with the endpoint for searching listings, however I'm pretty sure it supports batching: `https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item?item_ids=<id1>,<id2>,...` so it would basically just be one extra call, idk i'll consider it)
    - example of this: ssds are pretty hard to match since even with an advanced regex query searching for stuff like 500gb tends to match laptops / prebuilts too, if i re-implemented support for ebay's search feature then i could just query "500gb nvme ssd" or something and ebay's much smarter searching system knows (for the most part) what listings are actually SSDs and what listings are not, and then i could do the same price and deal matching stuff on those results
