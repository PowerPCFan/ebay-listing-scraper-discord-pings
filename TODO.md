- Refine the new async code to my liking
- I removed query mode because I don't like it really and it wastes API calls, but also there's the chance that the listing title wouldn't contain the keyword but the description would, so maybe I should re-add it with that in mind? Or somehow get the description in the current mode? (That would probably require calls for each listing though which would be super expensive since the endpoint for getting listing details shares a rate limit with the endpoint for searching listings, however I'm pretty sure it supports batching: `https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item?item_ids=<id1>,<id2>,...` so it would basically just be one extra call, idk i'll consider it)
